         and fixed. rc.conf values are automatically updated by toaster_setup.pl
       default cgi-bin location changed to www/cgi-bin.toaster (statically defined
         will avoid problems when ports opt to install cgi-bin, or cgi-bin.default,
         or cgi-bin-default, or whatever comes next)

        presuming I provide it), moved Changes back into doc/Changes.pod,
        added include lib "inc" into all test files (forgot that with 5.02
        release).

        Better pod descriptions for FreeBSD.pm, Mysql.pm, Apache.pm,
        Ezmlm.pm, Darwin.pm, DNS.pm, Provision.pm, Setup.pm, Passwd.pm,
        Perl.pm, and Toaster.pm. Updated META.yml to include license.

           the same result with less code)

     Utility.pm
       ask sub now returns $default value (instead of 0) if not interactive
       yes_or_no supports q shortcut for question argument

        ezmlm mysql support now depends on install_ezmlm_mysql setting
        instead of install_mysql.

        added support for vpopmail mysql database port number (thanks Erik!)

        vpopmail_mysql_database setting is now honored.

        busted huge vpopmail sub into a dozen smaller ones for easier
        maintenance.

        heredoc's used in creation of tcp.smtp used ' and needed "

        logic for NO_SENDMAIL test was inverted causing it to be added to
        /etc/make.conf more than once.

  5.02b - 2006.09.28
    index.cgi
        defined debug (caused it to not work)

  5.01 - 2006.09.22
    added help->vpopmail option to web interface
    added setup -s allspam option (enabled mail filtering for all users)
    default ports update mechanism is now portsnap
    removed dependency on Net::DNS (using dig)
        commented out v-webmail, roundcube, vqadmin, and ezmlm menu options.
        Those items are not installed by Mail::Toaster (yet).

        added code in -s all target to refresh the $conf hashref after -s
        config target is run

        moved $conf into the Setup.pm object. Significantly reduced the
        amount of passing $conf around from sub to sub.

        Archive::Tar to surpress dialog boxes.

        timer was not working in yes_or_no due to typo in param validation

        comments in mt-top.html

        default cvsup_supfile_sources settings is now cvsup-sources (was
        cvsup-stable)

        tweaks so "make test" runs with fewer warnings

        toaster_setup -s sources now auto-builds cvsup-sources if missing.
        The location for it is /usr/local/etc now.

  5.00 - 2006.09.18
    CODE QUALITY
        * Parameter validation for nearly all subroutines using
        Params::Validate. Backwards compatability is now destroyed, but that
        should not affect anyone as all published software that uses these
        functions is included with the distribution. Params::Validate is
        included in MT distribution.

        * Tests. Hundreds of new tests. In version 4, I added a plethora of
        tests, basically just making sure each sub and function would
        execute. Now most subs and functions have tests that verify inputs
        and results.

        * Switched to Test::More for tests. Provides more and better options
        for writing tests, comparing results, and figuring out where the
        tests failed.

        * Maillogs - a number of optimizations to make processing logs
        faster (shorter regexps, optimized ternaries to match common stuff
        first, removed POSIX requirement (lighten memory requirements),
        updated several of the counter functions to complain about unknown
        errors and values, more sanity checking in functions so they give up
        on errors instead of blithely charging ahead.

        * instead of eval's strewn all over to test for certain modules,
        added $perl->has_module

        * all objects are created with Class->new intead of new Class.

        * all errors raise exceptions by default. This requires callers to
        take specific action to change.

        * run tests early in subroutines, reduces giant if nests and makes
        it easier to read the code.

    MISC
        * Added Build.PL for use with Module::Build fans.

        * Greatly simplified Makefile.PL by moving "make cgi" and "make
        conf" logic into Setup.pm. Those functions are now accessed by
        toaster_setup targets.

        * OpenSSL config files are now updated automatically. Auto-generated
        certs now have the accurate information in them. Courier-IMAP certs
        are also updated automatically.

    DOCUMENTATION
        * Added three new test modules that test for: pod documentation for
        subs, pod formatting, and automatic checking of code to test for
        best practices.

        * moved POD documentation from being strewn about the files to the
        end of each file.

        * wrote and re-wrote significant portions of the documentation, as
        well as cleaned up formatting. Documentation is now easier to find
        as well.

         changed all tnpi.biz urls to tnpi.net
         shortened most tnpi.net urls to mail-toaster.org
         updated copyright notices to 2006
         moved usage() subs into pod docs and use pod2usage

    CODE FORMATTING & READABILITY
        * Used perltidy to format most of the source code.

        * Used perlcritic to identify and correct (almost) all instances
        where my code was not using best practices, as identified in Perl
        Best Practices.

        * All subroutines now take named arguments, making it easier to read
        the code and understand what is being sent and returned.

        * added "use English" pragma and replaced all the arcane $^ and $[
        perl variables with their english name equivalents.

    WEB INTERFACE/CGI
        * Completely new webmail/logon interface. Written entirely in HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript.

        * The format of toaster-watcher.conf is altered slightly. It is more
        consistent in the internal layout so that my programs can alter it
        reliably.

        * removed httpd.conf patches in favor of installing a
        mail-toaster.conf file with all the requisite apache directives.

        * Organized all the cgi related docs into cgi_files directory. They
        are now installed via the -s webmail target to toaster_setup.
